/*

Arrays :
---------

1. Arrays are fixed in size.
2. Wrt memory arrays are not recommended to use.
3. Wrt Performance Arrays are recommended to use.
4. Array can hold only homogeneous datatype elements
5. There is no underlying data structure for arrays and hence readymade method support is not available
6. Array can hold both primitives and object types

Collections :
-------------
1. Collections are growable in nature. I.e. based on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.
2. Wrt to memory collections are recommended to use.
3. Wrt Performance collections are not recommended to use.
4. Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous elements.
5. Every Collections class is implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence readymade method support is available for every requirement.
6. Collections can hold only objects but not primitives.
