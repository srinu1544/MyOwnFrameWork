/*

 Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger

 https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack

Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.

The goals of Hilt are:

To simplify Dagger-related infrastructure for Android apps.
To create a standard set of components and scopes to ease setup,
readability/understanding, and code sharing between apps.

To provide an easy way to provision different bindings to various build types (e.g. testing, debug, or release).
