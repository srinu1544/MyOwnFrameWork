/* @Volatile

The @Volatile keyword is used to:

-> Modify the value of a variable by different threads
-> Make classes thread safe
-> Force changes in a variable to be immediately visible to other threads

Here's an example of using the @Volatile annotation:

@Volatile var shutdownRequested = false */
