/*The Network Security Configuration feature uses an XML file where you specify the settings for your app. You must include an entry in your app's manifest to point to this file. The following code excerpt from a manifest demonstrates how to create this entry:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest ... >
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"
                    ... >
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>*/
