class :
-------
In Kotlin, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors
that all objects of that class will have. Classes are declared using the class keyword, followed by
the name of the class and a pair of curly braces.

Within the curly braces, you define the properties and methods of the class. Properties are variables
that belong to the class, and methods are functions that belong to the class.

To create an object from a class, you use the new keyword, followed by the name of the class.

For example, the following code creates a new object from the Person class:
val person = Person("John Doe")
