In this article, we will build an application in Android to implement a logging utility class that
is better than the default Log class of android. For that, we will be using Timber Library which is
a small logger with an extensible API. As Android developers, we use a lot of log statements in our
projects to generate outputs to test our application at different stages. Logs are of many types
like Verbose, Debug, Warn, Info, Error. We use all sorts of Log statements in our application
for finding errors and debugging. Once the application is ready to be released we need to remove
all the log statements so that the generated APK doesnâ€™t carry any additional application data.
To tackle this problem we have several ways:

Condition-based logging
ProGuard
Timber
