/* add dependency links

Firebase Dynamic Links are deep links that work the way you want them to. They can send users
to your app if you have it installed, the appropriate app store if they don't, or a fallback
page that you specify. Most importantly, these links survive the app store installation process,
so your app can retrieve the link information that originally brought the user to your app in
the first place, so you can provide them with a tailored first time experience.
