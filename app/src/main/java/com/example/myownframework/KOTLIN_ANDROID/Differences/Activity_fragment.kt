/*In Android app development, activities and fragments are essential
components that each have their own role in creating a seamless user experience

Here are some differences between activities and fragments:
------------------------------------------------------------
Activities
Activities are the highest-level components of an Android application and represent a screen.
They are a combination of XML files and Java files that contain the design and coding for the
application. Activities are used for simple user interfaces and for launching other components
of the app.

Fragments
Fragments are modular components used as part of activities. They are a reusable portion of
the app's UI that can be combined within activities. Fragments can't live on their own and
must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. They are used for more complex user interfaces
and for passing complex data between screens.

Here are some other differences between activities and fragments:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Role
Activities represent individual screens and handle navigation, while fragments offer
modularity and flexibility in building complex UIs.

Lifecycle
Fragments define and manage their own layout, have their own lifecycle, and can handle their own
input events.

Design
Fragments help enrich UI design, pass data between different screens, and adapt to different
device configurations.
