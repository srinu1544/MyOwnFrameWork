The volatile keyword in Kotlin is used to mark a variable as volatile.
A volatile variable is a variable that can be changed by multiple threads
at the same time. When a variable is marked as volatile, the JVM guarantees
that all threads will see the most recent value of the variable.

To use the volatile keyword, simply add it before the declaration of the variable.
For example:

volatile var myVariable = 0

Once a variable is marked as volatile, it is important to be aware of the following rules:
All writes to the variable must be visible to all threads.
All threads must see the most recent value of the variable.
Volatile variables cannot be cached by threads.

If you are not careful when using volatile variables, you can lead to race conditions.
 race condition is a bug that occurs when two or more threads are trying to access the
 same variable at the same time and the outcome of the program depends on the order in
  which the threads access the variable.

To avoid race conditions, it is important to use volatile variables correctly. Here are some
tips:
Only write to volatile variables from within a synchronized block.

Only read volatile variables from within a synchronized block or from a method that
is declared as synchronized.

Do not cache the value of a volatile variable.

By following these tips, you can help to avoid race conditions and ensure that your
code is thread-safe.

@Volatile:
----------


The @Volatile annotation in Kotlin is used to mark a property as volatile.
This means that any changes made to the property by one thread will be immediately
visible to all other threads. This is important for ensuring that all threads are
working with the same data.

The @Volatile annotation is similar to the volatile keyword in Java. However,
there are some important differences. In Java, the volatile keyword can only
be used with primitive variables. In Kotlin, the @Volatile annotation can be
used with any type of property.

Another difference is that the volatile keyword in Java guarantees both atomicity
 and visibility. This means that any changes made to a volatile variable will be
 made atomically and will be immediately visible to all other threads. The @Volatile
 annotation in Kotlin only guarantees visibility. This means that it is possible for
 changes to a volatile property to be made non-atomically. However, this is not a
 problem in most cases.

The @Volatile annotation is a powerful tool that can be used to ensure thread safety
in Kotlin applications. However, it is important to use it carefully. If the @Volatile
 annotation is used incorrectly, it can lead to unexpected results.*/
