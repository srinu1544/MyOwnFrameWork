Pattern #4 ðŸ‘Œ Facade
The Facade pattern provides a higher-level interface that makes a set of other interfaces
easier to use. The following diagram illustrates this idea in more.



 Use facade pattern when you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem ,
 to divide subsystem into layers by using facade to define an entry point to each subsystem
 level and simplify the dependencies between subsystems by making them communicate with
 each other solely through their facades.



Squareâ€™s Retrofit is an open-source Android library that helps you implement the Facade pattern.
 You create an interface to provide API data to client.*/
