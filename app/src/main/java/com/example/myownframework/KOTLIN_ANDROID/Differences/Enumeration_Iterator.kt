/*
Difference bw Enumeration and iterator
----------------------------------------

Enumeration is a legacy class and Enumeration is only read access while
their is no remove function in Enumeration

Iterator is universal cursor it has both read and write access

Limitations of Enumeration
-> it is legacy collection
-> Their is no write access (no remove method)
-> it is single direction cursor
