-> Type aliases provide alternative names for existing types.
-> If the type name is too long you can introduce a different shorter name and use the new one instead.


Explanation :
-------------

Imagine you are creating a project where you defined two classes with same name but different
packages and you have to use them at once. Generally, you need to use whole package name dot
class name format for the second one. For example, we have a class named ‘courses’ one in
“com.gfg.apps” package and another in “com.gfg_practice.apps”, we can use one out of them
using simple import and if we want to use second one we have to use full package name like
 “com.gfg_practice.apps.courses”.

In Kotlin, we have a solution for this named as Type aliases. Type aliases provide an alternate
name for the existing types (in our case it is a class).
In our above scenario, we can do:




*/


fun main(){

}
