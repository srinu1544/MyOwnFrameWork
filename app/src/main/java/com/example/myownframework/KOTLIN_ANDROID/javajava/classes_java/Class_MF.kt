/* class :
-----------

  In Java, the class is a blueprint from which we can create an individual object.
  Java provides a keyword named class by which we can declare a class. Inside the class,
  we define class members and functions.
  It is not possible to create Java programs without class.
  We can also refer a class as a user-defined data type because an object-oriented paradigm allows us to model real-world objects.
  In this section, we will focus on the types of classes in Java.
