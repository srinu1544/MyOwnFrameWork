Better camera previews:
Developers can improve the brightness of camera previews in low light.

Screen sharing:
Users can share select app windows during screen recording.

Health Connect API:
This API integrates more health and fitness data types, allowing users to monitor workouts,
sleep, and heart rate.

Android Dynamic Performance Framework:
This framework adds new facilities so that long-running background apps consume less power.
Apps can also report the lengths of previous work sessions, which may provide better-informed
estimates on battery, performance, and task completion.

System-wide toggle to enable or disable keyboard vibration:
 Users can now enable or disable keyboard vibration across all keyboards.

Platform Stability:
This milestone helps users plan their final testing and releases.
Android 15 is expected to reach Platform Stability at Beta 3 in June 2024
