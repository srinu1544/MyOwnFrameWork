/*
In a Room database in Java, you can store various types of data, including:

Primitive data types: Room supports storing primitive data types such as integers,
floats, doubles, booleans, and strings directly in the database.

Custom data types:
You can define your own data types and store them in the database.
Room allows you to specify custom type converters to convert these custom data types to
and from supported SQLite data types.

Lists and arrays:
You can store lists, arrays, and collections of primitive data types or custom
data types in the database. However, Room does not directly support storing complex data
structures like nested arrays or lists.

Relations:
 Room supports defining relationships between entities, allowing you
to model complex data structures and store related data in multiple tables.

Binary data:
You can store binary data, such as images or files, in the database by converting
them to byte arrays or using other appropriate serialization techniques.

Enumerations: Room supports storing enum types directly in the database.*/
