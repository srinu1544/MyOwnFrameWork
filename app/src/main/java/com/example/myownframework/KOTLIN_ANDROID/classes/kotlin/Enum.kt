/*
In Kotlin, an enum class is a special type of class that represents a fixed set of constants.
It's similar to enumerations in other programming languages. An enum class is defined using the
enum keyword, followed by a class declaration that contains the enum constants and, optionally,
properties and methods associated with those constants.*/


/*
when you use enun class

-> when you have a finite number of const values you can group them together in something called enum
-> Enum objects are constant values once create them can not be changed
-> Each enum constant is a separate instance of enum class
   They have properties of name and ordinal and methods of values() and valueOf()
-> you can assign own properties to each enum object using constructor
-> Enum class can implement interfaces. but they cannot inherit from abstract class or open class
-> You can use enum constants as a anonymous class
