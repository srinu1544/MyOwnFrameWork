Kapt  (the Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool)) :
------------------------------------------------
allows you to use Java annotation processors with Kotlin code, even if those processors don't have
specific support for Kotlin. This is done by generating Java stubs from your Kotlin files that the
processors can then read. This stub generation is an expensive operation and has a significant impact
on build speed.

KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) :
-------------------------------
is a Kotlin-first alternative to kapt. KSP analyzes Kotlin code directly, which is up to 2x faster.
It also has a better understanding of Kotlin's language constructs.

Kapt is now in maintenance mode, and we recommend migrating from kapt to KSP wherever possible.
In most cases, this migration only requires changes to your project's build configuration.

You can run kapt and KSP alongside each other in your project while you're migrating, and
the migration can be done module by module, library by library.

Android KTX stands for Kotlin Extension Library. It's a set of Kotlin extensions that are
included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise,
idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs
