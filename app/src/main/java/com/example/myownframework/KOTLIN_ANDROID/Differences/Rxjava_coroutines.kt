/*difference bw Rxjava and coroutines :

Concurrency Model:

RxJava: Follows the reactive programming paradigm, which focuses on data streams and the propagation of changes. It's based on the Observer pattern and uses streams of data called Observables and Observers.
Coroutines: Based on the concept of lightweight threads. Coroutines allow you to write asynchronous code sequentially, making it easier to understand and maintain. They are part of the Kotlin language and seamlessly integrate with existing code.
Syntax:

RxJava: Uses fluent and functional constructs to define operations on streams of data. This can sometimes lead to complex code, especially for beginners.
Coroutines: Employs structured concurrency, allowing developers to write asynchronous code in a sequential, imperative style, similar to regular synchronous code. This can make it easier to read and understand.
Error Handling:

RxJava: Provides comprehensive error handling mechanisms, allowing you to handle errors at different points in the data stream.
Coroutines: Error handling in coroutines is similar to traditional try-catch blocks, making it intuitive for developers familiar with imperative programming.
Backpressure:

RxJava: Built-in support for handling backpressure, which is essential when dealing with asynchronous streams of data where the producer is faster than the consumer.
Coroutines: Backpressure handling in coroutines requires additional libraries like Kotlin Flow or channels.
Interoperability:

RxJava: Supports Java and Kotlin, making it suitable for projects with mixed-language environments.
Coroutines: Native to Kotlin, but also provides interoperability with Java code.
Learning Curve:

RxJava: Has a steeper learning curve due to its functional programming paradigm and the complex set of operators it provides.
Coroutines: Generally considered to have a gentler learning curve, especially for developers already familiar with Kotlin.
Community Support:

RxJava: Has been around for a longer time and has a mature ecosystem with extensive community support.
Coroutines: Growing rapidly in popularity within the Kotlin community, with increasing library support and resources.
