Usage :
-------

A dialog is a modal window that appears in front of app content to provide critical information
or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on
screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly. A less disruptive
alternative is to use a menu, which provides options without interrupting a userâ€™s experience
