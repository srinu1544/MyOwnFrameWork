/*
A persistent list in Kotlin is a list that cannot be modified after it is created.
This means that you cannot add, remove, or replace elements in the list. However,
you can create a new list that is a copy of the original list with the changes you want.

Persistent lists are useful because they are immutable. This means that they cannot be changed
by accident or by another part of your program. This makes them ideal for use in situations where
 you need to ensure that the data is always consistent.

There are a few different ways to create a persistent list in Kotlin. One way is to use the
 persistentListOf() function. This function takes a list of elements as its argument and
 returns a new persistent list that contains those elements.

Another way to create a persistent list is to use the persistentSetOf() function. This function
 takes a set of elements as its argument and returns a new persistent set that contains those elements.

Finally, you can also create a persistent list using the persistentMapOf() function. This function takes
 a map of elements as its argument and returns a new persistent map that contains those elements.

Persistent lists are a powerful tool that can be used to make your code more reliable and easier to
 maintain. If you are working with a situation where you need to ensure that the data is always consistent,
 then you should consider using a persistent list.*/
