package com.example.myownframework.Kotlin_Android.Kotlin.Visibility_modifiers

/*Classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, and functions, as well as properties
and their setters, can have visibility modifiers. Getters always have the same
visibility as their properties.


There are four visibility modifiers in Kotlin: private, protected, internal, and public.
 The default visibility is public.*/
